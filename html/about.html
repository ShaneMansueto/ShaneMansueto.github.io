            <div class="challenge-grid">
                <input type="radio" name="challenge" id="challenge-1" checked="checked">
                <label for="challenge-1">Simplicity vs Complexity</label>
                <p>Impact vs usability. Interaction or ease-of-use. Implementing features that would amaze users or maintaining minimal abilities to have the least stressful and easiest UI</p>

                <input type="radio" name="challenge" id="challenge-2">
                <label for="challenge-2">Developer Experience vs User Experience</label>
                <p>Developing for the user or for myself. Creating a better experience in viewing the site, or a better experience making the site. Allocating time to have a better development enviroment, taking time off generating the actual contens of a page.</p>

                <input type="radio" name="challenge" id="challenge-3">                
                <label for="challenge-3">Restrictions</label>
                <p>Untainted is based on the concept of develped only using native HTML and CSS files, and functionality. If it's not a HTML/CSS script then it doesn't won't exist in my website. The inclusion of <b>images, audio, videos, programming-languages, and other file types</b> would not be present in my site.</p>
                
                <input type="radio" name="challenge" id="challenge-4">
                <label for="challenge-4">HTML & CSS</label>
                <p>A lot of documentation is needed to be read to form functions and design. There are numerous methods to perform an action in HTML and CSS. In reference the number of different ways to select in CSS is astounding. It is difficult to know whether or not a simple method exists for a certain task or not. As such this particular interactive block which I had improvised with CSS, I later found out can be done using only HTML.</p>
