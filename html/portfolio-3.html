            <p>
RGB as an example uses one byte for red, and two others green and blue, where the highest possible number of each byte is represented by 11111111 in binary, 255 in decimal, and FF in hexadecimal.

            <p>
Converting a number system to different one, like converting decimal to hexadecimal can turn data
to something that’s easier to type and take-note-of, (e.g., rgb(51,255,201) → #33FFC9).

            <h3>Analysis / Reaction</h3>
            <p>
Hex is very common in programming, you can often
stumble upon it when dealing with computer memory and system
architecture. When you try to open a file there are times wherein it
does not show the intended content but however shows the hex
code representation of what is contained within the file. As a
programmer it is a good practice to know and use these number
systems, such as being able to read an RGB value encoded using
hex, since it is easier to remember and write rather than three sets
of 3-digit decimal values.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
Our predecessors created these systems during their time
to have a structured basis of interpreting data that’s easy to use,
understand, and hardware efficient. These systems save
programmers significant time and energy in finding-out what is the
actual significance of a string of code. Number systems can also
save resources in computation and computer processing,
especially with the use of a computer system tailored specifically
to that certain number system.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
The use and history of number systems are integral to modern computation, such that they enable past and
even present systems to function and enable programmers to create complex systems easier and a lot faster.
Computers themselves use binary strings to function. Standard computers is limited to only understanding binary bit
representation. All other number systems are translated to binaries for the computer.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
The octal number system was used in
older systems to ease the complexity of
using/writing systems in binary. Nowadays
hex is a more prevalent solution for
simplicity, this is the case today/been made
possible due to the advances of technology,
changing to systems that supports the use
of more bits.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
The use of bigger number systems
may be a possibility in the future for systems
that may support bigger sizes and higher
precision, such that the numbers presented
become incredibly difficult to read and
writing those numbers become dreadful to
do.
