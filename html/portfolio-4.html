            <h3>Engineering tools for education</h3>
            <p>
Students not understanding lectures for all academic levels. From what I've
seen from my years of attending grade school to first-year university, it is
easy to observe that the overall learning in the classroom is very inefficient
than as to what it could be. The lectures given by the person talking in front
whether they be a teacher or a student, are always either structured in a
way that perceives the audience having knowledge so much more, or so
much less than what they actually have regarding that subject.

            <p>
However solving this problem would take a daunting amount of time, the
more viable solution left-behind would be to just go around it. Such as
giving a short-summary just enough for the audience to piece together the
current topic by themselves. This in exchange gives a different problem, as
how can this now be done efficiently. This is where software for education
comes in.

            <p>
With the use of graphical frameworks, interfaces, whether
MICROSOFT_WORD, MANIM, POWERPOINT, or BLENDER having a tool to
present the idea across while abstracting the idea itself into something is
easier for the majority to understand. The drawback to this approach would
be the initial setup and learning curve in using whatever and many tools are
chosen.

            <h3>Crypto the new norm</h3>
            <p>
Many people nowadays prefer the use of digital currency instead of bringing
actual physical cash. The ability to access your deposit from any place with
internet connection is more convenient than going to the nearest bank or
ATM to withdraw some cash.

            <p>
Digital transactions are common occurrences in this day and age, especially
with the existence of shopping apps. And due to its ease of use and the
spike of digital adaption during the COVID-19 pandemic, many physical
businesses today give their customers the option to pay using digital
currency. Digitalized transaction allows the ability to have purchases
globally from anywhere in the world, and also have the ability to pay on-
time or a head of time.

            <p>
There are also other benefits in most digital currency such as crypto using
BLOCKCHAIN, which is used to decentralize transactions. Meaning
transactions are not reliant on a central figure like the bank, but is
maintained by a network of workers. Most crypto currency however are not
tied to a stable exchange rate, a good example of this would be BITCOIN
wherein the value fluctuates each day.

            <h3>MY AI OVERLORDS</h3>
            <p>
Machine learning, AI, the latest trend. The fast pace development of
computer technologies leave everyone worried and amazed. Worried that
they would not be able to keep-up, that the speed in which they are
learning about the newest technologies are behind that of the speed in
which they are developed.

            <p>
The average person has turned to AI as a means of understanding
knowledge, and summarizing text in less than a quarter of the time it would
take them to do it themselves. Whilst researchers create their own
programs, using them for discovering new information via rapid trial and
error which is possible by the current capabilities of computer hardware.

            <p>
AI has had many contributions in modern research or in text generation for
the average person, and thus the demand for AI continues to increase.
However the more the AI model scales the more computational power it
would consume, the model would now be limited by the capabilities of
their hardware. Thus companies invest not in only creating the newest AI
model, but also in the creation of the best computer hardware and server
hardware.
