            <h3>Computing Disciplines and Majors</h3>
            <p>
Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software
Engineering, Information Technology, and Information
Systems the 5 Computing disciplines. In which the
disciplines Computer Science and Software
Engineering deals with the development of computer
software.</p>

            <p>
Where Computer Science leans more towards
infrastructure software, which includes operating
systems, tools, and platforms. On the other hand
Software Engineering leans towards application
software, which are the apps people are more familiar
with.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
In the hardware side of things exists Computer
Engineering, which deals with developing physical
computer chips and electronics, and integrates them
with embedded-software. The last two disciplines,
Information Technology and Information Systems
deals with implementing and managing computer
products and systems.

            <h3>Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
Subjects that falls under the Computer
Science umbrella includes arguably the
widest assortment of specified specialties
among all disciplines, such as the inclusion
of Cybersecurity, Machine Learning,
Computing Algorithms, etc.. Ideal for
persons with interest in computer research
and development, especially theoretical
aspects.

            <h3>Computer Engineering</h3>
            <p>
Computer Engineering includes learning
both hardware and software, specifically
embedded-software. Computer engineers
are able to build, understand, and develop
electronic parts and devices. They are
responsible for building hardware for
computers, servers, consoles, etc… The
discipline includes subjects such as
Embedded-programming, Electronics,
Hardware Design, etc…

            <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
            <p>
Software Engineering, a discipline focused
heavily in software design and application.
A software may go through all processes
from the start of the project to the
implementation of their applications. They
are responsible for creating apps that are
easy to use for the general user. Having the
need to learn Software Design, Software
Analysis, etc…

            <h3>Information Technology vs Information Systems</h3>
            <h4>how do they differ?</h4>
            <p>
Both similar in the aspect that they are
farther away from the actual development
of hardware and software than the other
disciplines, and that they can fit the same
roles, they still have different primary
objectives. Whilst Information Technology
focuses on maintaining, managing and
implementing systems that process data,
Information Systems work on the data and
data processing itself, they do largely data
analysis, interpretation and prediction.
