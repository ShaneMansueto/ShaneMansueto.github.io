            <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>
Data is essentially an input to a
process that outputs meaningful
information. Data by itself is hard
to interpret without context and
inspection. Since data can be
raw and abstract processes
would be necessary for
understanding its relevance.
            </p>

        <section class="slide" id="page-3">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
Data contains important details
collected from or by the user and
are then processed into
information that the user is able to
view and comprehend with much
more ease. The more data
available in a system the more
accurate and comprehensible its
output information becomes.
            </p>

        <section class="slide" id="page-4">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
The processes of data collection,
management and analysis are a
substantial part in many systems
(e.g., banking, management,
and networking). Furthermore
the process of accessing data is
one of earliest step taken at the
start of any computer program.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
Information Systems manages
everything needed to access
and use data and datasets, from
the collection of data, to the
storing of data in datasets inside
databases, to the processing of
data, and its circulation.

        </section>
        <section class="slide" id="page-6">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
Information Systems also
includes everything needed to
maintain its processes (e.g.,
hardware (CPUs, servers, etc...),
system software, maintenance
personnel, and data analysts).

        <section class="slide" id="page-7">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>
There are six types of
information systems TPS, OAS,
KWS, MIS, DSS, and ESS. Each
has their own different use
cases, collected data and
datasets, data processing
method and information
synthesized.

            <h3>REACTION</h3>
            <p>
Information systems are an integral
part in modern society. We implore
the use of computer computations
to analyze complex datasets that
would usually take weeks if not
months to synthesize. Information
systems make online transactions
possible and usable. It takes a big
network of servers in an
information system to connect
multiple people online.

            <h3></h3>
            <p>
In searching of references for
information systems there is an
apparent disparity of resources
pertaining directly towards the
courses IT and IS compared to
computer science. Subjects
relating to those courses fall under
the CS umbrella but is difficult to
know which subjects would directly
fall under IT or IS.
